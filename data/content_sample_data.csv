Your risk is 20.4% which is relatively high. This means that if there were five people who had the same characteristics as you, one of them would have a severe event in the next 10 years. /Diabetes: Dan we noticed you have Type II Diabetes. Diabetes can damage your blood vessels, it is crucial that you are managing your blood sugar. Done correctly, this will help you reduce your chances of a heart attack, stroke and even death. When your diabetes is well monitored, the risk is still present, and can be even greater when blood sugars are not controlled. As you can see, diabetes is an intermediate risk which makes the endpoint risks a greater danger for you. /Blood Pressure: Your blood pressure is 135/70, which is above the normal level of 120/80. High blood pressure increases the heartâ€™s workload, causing the heart muscle to thicken and become stiffer. This stiffening of the heart muscle is not normal and causes the heart to function abnormally. It also increases your risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and congestive heart failure. When high blood pressure is present alongside obesity, smoking, high blood cholesterol levels or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases even more."

A sedentary lifestyle lowers HDL (good) cholesterol. Less HDL means there is less good cholesterol to remove LDL (bad) cholesterol from your arteries. Just 40 minutes of aerobic exercise (of moderate to vigorous intensity) three to four times a week is enough to lower both cholesterol and high blood pressure. And there are lots of options: brisk walking, swimming, cycling or even a dance class can fit the bill."
